    "about_text_1": "In the chaos of data, the noise of the matrix, the constant flow of information — there lies our laboratory. Where others see disorder, we find patterns. Where habit limits, exploration discovers. Random is that necessary disturbance that breaks the predictable to achieve the extraordinary.",
    "about_text_2": "The best solution doesn't come from the manual — it comes from breaking the rule, testing, adjusting. The matrix falls with its infinite code, but there, in the noise, is the exact temperature, the precise time, the perfect cut. Random is that exploration: we disturb the water to see the waves, we observe energy forming galaxy, we capture holographic vibrations. Not because we seek chaos — we seek it because that's where learning is. We break habit to find the way. We get lost in the unknown to discover what we didn't know existed. That's what we're here for: to turn randomness into intention, noise into clarity, disturbance into creation."
